description: Learn how to set up a Kubernetes cluster for your Coder deployment.
---

You can deploy Coder into any [compatible Kubernetes cluster]. Coder follows the
[Kubernetes upstream version support policy] and the latest stable release
version of Coder supports the previous two minor releases as well as the current
release. While Coder may run on older versions of Kubernetes, we strongly
recommend running one of the supported versions, in order to receive applicable
fixes, including security fixes, from the project maintainers.

This section contains guides for creating a compatible cluster on common cloud
platforms, including Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web
Services. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you may wish to proceed to
the [installation guide].
