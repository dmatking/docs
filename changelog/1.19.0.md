### Breaking changes ‚ùó

- infra: Workspace assets created by Coder previously located at `/opt/coder`,
  such as code-server and coder-cli, have been moved to `/var/tmp/coder`
- infra: Workspaces as code templates have been updated from version _0.1_ to
  _0.2_. Version _0.1_ templates will no longer work.
- web: The flow for workspaces as code no longer includes a clone step. The form
  to build a button located at **Manage** > **Admin** > **Templates** no longer
  uses the following fields: _Project Repository URL_ and _Project Git Service_.
  Buttons created from prior versions will still work, but a project will not be
  cloned as part of the flow. In order to automate project cloning, use
